# About the project
Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 542 isolates from infected patients admitted to 40 hospitals in 27 Chinese cities between 2016-2020 . The obtained reads were trimmed by Trimmomatic v0.39 and strain assemblies were generated using EToKi assemble. The assembled genomes were annotated using PROKKA.
